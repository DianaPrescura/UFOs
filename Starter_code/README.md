Creating a webpage

## Overview of Project
    The main purpose of this project is to create a UFO sightings webpage. The analysis is realised as a result of creating filters that would allow different users to run multiple criteria such as city, state, country and shape, all in the same time.

## Results
    In order to fulfill our task, we had to use HTML, JavaScript, CSS that were supported by the code editor, VS Code.
    The way the filters can be used, is just by typing the desired search criteria into the specified search fields. For example, by typing "Bonita" in the "Filter by City", the table that has been created should provide more information about the state, the country where the UFO has been spotted on one hand, and on the other hand the shape of the UFO and the duration it has been noticed. In addition, it will provide some comments related to the appearance of the UFO.
   
    
## Summary
    As a conclusion, we could say that even though the webpage is relatively easy to access, and to get the information form, there are different ways of improving it.
    One way to improve it would be creating the sorting functions, that would allow the users to access more specific or relevant data, and a good example would be sorting by Date, ascending or descending.
